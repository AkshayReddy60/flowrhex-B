            Process Intensification is making a process either chemical or
            non-chemical highly efficient by featuring process miniaturization,
            safety and cost effectiveness to that process. Process
            Intensification can be achieved by reducing the size of equipment,
            time for production, costs involved with the production and risk and
            hazards associated with the process. Many unit operations in
            chemical industry like mixing, heat transfer, reaction, distillation
            are being intensified by developing new units or methodologies for
            specific operations.

            Flow Chemistry is carrying out a chemical process in continuous way.
            It provides multiple advantages to a process such as integrated
            operating conditions, precise parameter control, easier automation,
            safety and intensified heat and mass transfer, etc. With the use of
            microchannel technology and flow chemistry, many unit operations can
            be easily intensified.

            At FlowRHEXÂ®, we are dedicated to implement intensification for different unit operations, with the aim of developing end to end intensified processes. Currently, we have received government grant for development of Intensified Distillation Unit. Simultaneously we are working on developing Intensified Crystallization based solution.
